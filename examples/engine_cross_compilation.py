# Defining an engine in Wasmer is one of the fundamental steps.
#
# As a reminder, an engine applies roughly 2 steps:
#
#   1. It compiles the Wasm module bytes to executable code, through
#      the intervention of a compiler,
#   2. It stores the executable code somewhere.
#
# This example focuses on the first step: the compiler. It
# illustrates how the abstraction over the compiler is so powerful
# that it is possible to cross-compile a Wasm module.
#
# You can run the example directly by executing in Wasmer root:
#
# ```shell
# $ python examples/engine_cross_compilation.py
# ```
#
# Ready?

target = target.Target(triple, cpu_features)

# Define the engine that will drive everything.
#
# In this case, the engine is `wasmer.engine.Dylib` which means that
# a native object is going to be generated.
#
# That's where we specify the target for the compiler.
# Use the Dylib engine.

# Create a store, that holds the engine.

# Let's compile the Wasm module.
module = Module(store, wasm_bytes)

assert isinstance(module, Module)

# Congrats, the Wasm module is cross-compiled!
#
# What to do with that? It is possible to use an engine (probably a
# headless engine) to execute the cross-compiled Wasm module an the
# targeted platform.
